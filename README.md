# Dev Config

Configuration files for my developer environment. Currently WIP.

## Setup

Run `./setup` to symlink the config files into their proper places.

## Scripts

- `./setup`
  - Runs all config scripts, adds system symlinks, etc.
- `./homebrew/setup`
  - This will install, update, and clean Homebrew.
  - It will install any packages listed in `./homebrew/packages.txt`
- `./Neovim/plugins`
  - This will install and / or update all the Neovim plugins.

## TODO

List of things that I need to add.

- [ ] Git
- [ ] PHP / Composer
- [ ] Zsh / Oh-My-Zsh
